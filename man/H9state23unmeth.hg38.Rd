\description{
Hypermethylated targets in bivalent histone sites from H9 embryonic stem
cells which were unmethylated across normal cells for hg38 genome
}
\details{
GRanges was generated by taking the HMM-derived CpG islands (described in
?HMM_CpG_islands.hg38) and overlapping with regions that were unmethylated in
normal H9 stem cells and had a ChromHMM state of 2 or 3 (see
https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1906#MOESM194 for a description of
ChromHMM)
Return type: GRanges
